# ArtificialLift-Recommender
A simple yet effective Python tool that recommends the most suitable artificial lift method based on key input parameters: reservoir depth, expected flow rate, fluid type (light or heavy), and availability of lift gas.
It uses practical field-based logic to provide recommendations such as Sucker Rod Pump (SRP), Progressing Cavity Pump (PCP), Gas Lift, Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP), Hydraulic Jet Pump, or Plunger/Intermittent Gas Lift.
